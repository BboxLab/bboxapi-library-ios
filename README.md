==================
The iOs library is built to easily use the BboxAPI of the new Bbox Miami.

Cocoadoc: http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/BboxApi/0.1/

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods is required to build BboxApi.

To integrate BboxApi into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'BboxApi'
end
```
